# Cloud-Driven Sustainability: Carbon Footprint Estimation and Environmental Impact Analysis 
Amazon Web Services (AWS) based project to store, process, and analyze individual lifestyle data.

## Introduction
Climate change and global warming, driven largely by carbon emissions, present an urgent global challenge that demands immediate action. With individuals contributing significantly through daily activities like energy use, dietary choices, transportation, and waste disposal, there is a pressing need for accessible tools that provide accurate carbon footprint estimates and practical recommendations to promote sustainable behavior. This work introduces a cloud-based system on AWS that leverages machine learning to estimate individual carbon footprints based on lifestyle data and deliver actionable insights to reduce emissions. The system utilizes scalable cloud infrastructure to ensure global accessibility, real-time processing, and cost-effectiveness while maintaining energy efficiency and ethical operational standards. Through dynamic visualizations, tailored recommendations, and a user-friendly interface, the solution not only empowers individuals but also serves as a valuable resource for policymakers, educators, and organizations. This approach bridges the gap between awareness and action, fostering a deeper understanding of environmental impact and enabling collective progress toward sustainability goals
